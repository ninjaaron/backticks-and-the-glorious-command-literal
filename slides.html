# Backticks and the Glorious Command Literal

# a (not live) Demo...

---

```bash
$ echo "hello, bash"
```

---

```bash
$ echo "hello, bash"
hello, bash
```

---

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> puts `echo "hello, ruby"`
```

---

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> puts `echo "hello, ruby"`
hello, ruby
```

---


```julia
julia> run(`echo "hello, julia"`)
```

---

```julia
julia> run(`echo "hello, julia"`)
hello, julia
```

---

```bash
$ str=$'hello\nbash'
$ echo $str
```

---

```bash
$ str=$'hello\nbash'
$ echo $str
hello bash
```

where's the newline?

---

```ruby
irb(main):002:0> str = "hello\nruby"
=> "hello\nruby"
irb(main):003:0> puts `echo #{str}`
```

---

```ruby
irb(main):002:0> str = "hello\nruby"
=> "hello\nruby"
irb(main):003:0> puts `echo #{str}`
```

hangs indefinitely...

---

```julia
julia> str = "hello\njulia"
"hello\njulia"

julia> run(`echo $str`)
```

---

```julia
julia> str = "hello\njulia"
"hello\njulia"

julia> run(`echo $str`)
hello
julia
```

works...

---

Can be fixed like this (same works in Ruby):

```bash
$ echo "$str"  # in Ruby: puts `echo "#{str}"`
```

---

Can be fixed like this (same works in Ruby):

```bash
$ echo "$str"  # in Ruby: puts `echo "#{str}"`
hello
bash
```

---

One more:

```bash
$ str="a \"goofy string"
$ echo "$str"
```

---

One more:

```bash
$ str="a \"goofy string"
$ echo "$str"
a "goofy string
```

Bash is OK here.

---

```ruby
irb(main):004:0> str = "a \"goofy string"
=> "a \"goofy string"
irb(main):005:0> puts `echo "#{str}"`
```

---

```ruby
irb(main):004:0> str = "a \"goofy string"
=> "a \"goofy string"
irb(main):005:0> puts `echo "#{str}"`
sh: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string

=> nil
```

Ruby has problems. Also note that this command returns normally, without
throwing an error.

---

```julia
julia> str = "a \"goofy string"
"a \"goofy string"

julia> run(`echo $str`)
```

---

```julia
julia> str = "a \"goofy string"
"a \"goofy string"

julia> run(`echo $str`)
a "goofy string
```

Works...

---

(How to actually do it in Ruby)

```ruby
irb(main):029:0> puts IO.popen(["echo", str]).read
a "goofy string
```

# Never use backtics in Ruby or Perl because...

---

```ruby
irb(main):008:0> str = 'ruby"; bash; "'
=> "ruby\"; bash; \""
irb(main):009:0> `echo "#{str}"`
```

---

# Python fixes all this...

---

# ... with this beautiful API...

```python
>>> string = "a \"goofy string"
>>> import subprocess
>>> print(subprocess.run(["echo", string], universal_newlines=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout)
a "goofy string
```

---

# What's going on here?

- Bash retokenizes unquoted variables on whitespace.
- Ruby just interpolates the string right in there, like a madman.
- Julia... does something else entirely.

---

# backticks in Julia create an object

```julia
julia> str = "foo bar"
"foo bar"

julia> command = `echo $str`
`echo 'foo bar'`

julia> typeof(command)
Cmd
```

---

```julia
julia> fieldnames(Cmd)
(:exec, :ignorestatus, :flags, :env, :dir)

julia> # exec is the most interesting part

julia> command.exec
2-element Array{String,1}:
 "echo" 
 "foo bar"
```

---

# Using exec means Julia is safe...

... Unless you're using ssh or program that spawns a shell. In that
case, use `Base.shell_escape`

```julia
julia> arg = Base.shell_escape("a problematic argument (for ssh)")
"'a problematic argument (for ssh)'"
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

Iterables are expanded:

```julia
julia> a = 1:3
1:3

julia> `echo $a`
`echo 1 2 3`
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

We have Cartesian products (like Bash, only not):

```julia
julia> b = 4:6
4:6

julia> # compare with `echo {1..3}{4..6}` in Bash

julia> `echo $a$b`
`echo 14 15 16 24 25 26 34 35 36`
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

No IO redirection syntax inside backticks (yet). Use `pipeline`.

```julia
julia> # Bash: echo foo | tr a-z A-Z

julia> pipeline(`echo foo`, `tr a-z A-Z`) |> run;
FOO
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

Backticks support `$()`, but it interpolates Julia expressions, not
shell commands. (Usually what you want anyway. On the other hand,
interpolating command output is problematic.)

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

Non-zero exit codes throw and exception, which is what it should do,
which is what other languages don't do.

```julia
julia> run(`cat foo`)
cat: foo: No such file or directory
ERROR: failed process: Process(`cat foo`, ProcessExited(1)) [1]
Stacktrace:
 [1] error(::String, ::Base.Process, ::String, ::Int64, ::String) at ./error.jl:42
 [2] pipeline_error at ./process.jl:785 [inlined]
 [3] #run#515(::Bool, ::Function, ::Cmd) at ./process.jl:726
 [4] run(::Cmd) at ./process.jl:724
 [5] top-level scope at none:0
```

---

You can escape this in various ways:

```julia
julia> Cmd(`cat foo`; ignorestatus=true) |> run
cat: foo: No such file or directory
Process(`cat foo`, ProcessExited(1))

julia> # or:

julia> run(`cat foo`; wait=false) |> success
false
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

Any (maybe) function that can take a file object as an argument can
take a command to work on its output.

```julia
julia> for line in eachline(`ls /`)
           uppercase(line) |> println
       end
BIN
BOOT
CDROM
DEV
ETC
HOME
...
```

---

# Other tidbits about backticks

Processes are totally async'd, so feel free to use them liberally in
coroutines.
